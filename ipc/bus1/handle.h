/**
 * DOC: Handles
 *
 * The object system on a bus is based on 'nodes' and 'handles'. Any peer can
 * allocate new, local objects at any time. The creator automatically becomes
 * the sole owner of the object. References to objects can be passed as payload
 * of messages. The recipient will then gain their own reference to the object
 * as well. Additionally, an object can be the destination of a message, in
 * which case the message is always sent to the original creator (and thus the
 * owner) of the object.
 *
 * Internally, objects are called 'nodes'. A reference to an object is a
 * 'handle'. Whenever a new node is created, the owner implicitly gains an
 * handle as well. In fact, handles are the only way to refer to a node. The
 * node itself is entirely hidden in the implementation.
 *
 * Whenever a handle is passed as payload of a message, the target peer will
 * gain a handle linked to the same underlying node. This works regardless
 * of whether the sender is the owner of the underlying node, or not.
 *
 * Each peer can identify all its handles (both owned and un-owned) by a 64bit
 * integer. The namespace is local to each peer, and the numbers cannot be
 * compared with the numbers of other peers (in fact, they will be very likely
 * to clash, but might still have *different* underlying nodes). However, if a
 * peer receives a reference to the same node multiple times, the resulting
 * handle will be the same. The kernel keeps count of how often each peer owns a
 * handle.
 *
 * If a peer no longer requires a specific handle, it can release it. If the
 * peer releases its last reference to a handle, the handle will be destroyed.
 *
 * The ID of an handle is never reused. That is, once a handle was fully
 * released, any new handle the peer receives will have a different ID. Note,
 * however, that the handle of the owner of a node is internally pinned. As
 * such, it is always reused if the owner gains a handle to its own node again
 * (this is required for explicit node destruction).
 *
 * The owner of a node (and *only* the owner) can trigger the destruction of a
 * node (even if other peers still own handles to it). In this case, all peers
 * that own a handle are notified of this fact.
 * Once all handles to a specific node have been released (except for the handle
 * internally pinned in the node itself), the owner of the node is notified of
 * this, so it can potentially destroy both any linked state and the node
 * itself.
 *
 * Node destruction is fully synchronized with any transaction. That is, a node
 * and all its handles are valid in every message that is transmitted *before*
 * the notification of its destruction. Furthermore, no message after this
 * notification will carry the ID of such a destroyed node.
 * Note that message transactions are fully async. That is, there is no unique
 * point in time that a message is synchronized with another message. Hence,
 * whether a specific handle passed with a message is still valid or not,
 * cannot be predicted by the sender, but only by one of the receivers.
