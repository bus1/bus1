/**
 * DOC: Message Queue
 *
 * (You are highly encouraged to read up on 'Lamport Timestamps', the
 *  concept of 'happened-before', and 'causal ordering'. The queue
 *  implementation has its roots in Lamport Timestamps, treating a set of local
 *  CPUs as a distributed system to avoid any global synchronization.)
 *
 * A message queue is a FIFO, i.e., messages are linearly ordered by the time
 * they were sent. Moreover, atomic delivery of messages to multiple queues are
 * supported, without any global synchronization, i.e., the order of message
 * delivery is consistent across queues.
 *
 * Messages can be destined for multiple queues, hence, we need to be careful
 * that all queues get a consistent order of incoming messages. We define the
 * concept of `global order' to provide a basic set of guarantees. This global
 * order is a partial order on the set of all messages. The order is defined as:
 *
 *   1) If a message B was queued *after* a message A, then: A < B
 *
 *   2) If a message B was queued *after* a message A was dequeued, then: A < B
 *
 *   3) If a message B was dequeued *after* a message A on the same queue,
 *      then: A < B
 *
 *      (Note: Causality is honored. `after' and `before' do not refer to the
 *             same task, nor the same queue, but rather any kind of
 *             synchronization between the two operations.)
 *
 * The queue object implements this global order in a lockless fashion. It
 * solely relies on a distributed clock on each queue. Each message to be sent
 * causes a clock tick on the local clock and on all destination clocks.
 * Furthermore, all clocks are synchronized, meaning they're fast-forwarded in
 * case they're behind the highest of all participating peers. No global state
 * tracking is involved.
 *
 * During a message transaction, we first queue a message as 'staging' entry in
 * each destination with a preliminary timestamp. This timestamp is explicitly
 * odd numbered. Any odd numbered timestamp is considered 'staging' and causes
 * *any* message ordered after it to be blocked until it is no longer staging.
 * This allows us to queue the message in parallel with any racing multicast,
 * and be guaranteed that all possible conflicts are blocked until we eventually
 * commit a transaction. To commit a transaction (after all staging entries are
 * queued), we choose the highest timestamp we have seen across all destinations
 * and re-queue all our entries on each peer using that timestamp. Here we use a
 * commit timestamp (even numbered).
 *
 * With this in mind, we define that a client can only dequeue messages from
 * its queue that have an even timestamp. Furthermore, if there is a message
 * queued with an odd timestamp that is lower than the even timestamp of
 * another message, then neither message can be dequeued. They're considered to
 * be in-flight conflicts. This guarantees that two concurrent multicast
 * messages can be queued without any *global* locks, but either can only be
 * dequeued by a peer if their ordering has been established (via commit
 * timestamps).
 *
 * NOTE: A fully committed message is not guaranteed to be ready to be dequeued
 *       as it may be blocked by a staging entry. This means that there is an
 *       arbitrary (though bounded) time from a message transaction completing
 *       when the queue may still appear to be empty. In other words, message
 *       transmission is not instantaneous. It would be possible to change this
 *       at the cost of shortly blocking each message transaction on all other
 *       conflicting tasks.
 *
 * The queue implementation uses an rb-tree (ordered by timestamps and sender),
 * with a cached pointer to the front of the queue.

	 * However, due to the distributed nature of the queue-clocks, multiple
