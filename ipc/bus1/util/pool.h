/**
 * DOC: Pools
 *
 * A pool is a shmem-backed memory pool shared between userspace and the kernel.
 * The pool is used to transfer memory from the kernel to userspace without
 * requiring userspace to allocate the memory.
 *
 * The pool is managed in slices, which are published to userspace when they are
 * ready to be read and must be released by userspace when userspace is done
 * with them.
 *
 * Userspace has read-only access to its pools and the kernel has read-write
 * access, but published slices are not altered.

/**
 * struct bus1_pool_slice - pool slice
 * @offset:		relative offset in parent pool
 * @size:		slice size
 * @free:		whether this slice is in-use or not
 * @ref_kernel:		whether a kernel reference exists
 * @ref_user:		whether a user reference exists
 * @entry:		link into linear list of slices
 * @rb:			link to busy/free rb-tree
 *
 * Each chunk of memory in the pool is managed as a slice. A slice can be
 * accessible by both the kernel and user-space, and their access rights are
 * managed independently. As long as the kernel has a reference to a slice, its
 * offset and size can be accessed freely and will not change. Once the kernel
 * drops its reference, it must not access the slice, anymore.
 *
 * To allow user-space access, the slice must be published. This marks the slice
 * as referenced by user-space. Note that all slices are always readable by
 * user-space, since the entire pool can be mapped. Publishing a slice only
 * marks the slice as referenced by user-space, so it will not be modified or
 * removed. Once user-space releases its reference, it should no longer access
 * the slice as it might be modified and/or overwritten by other data.
 *
 * Only if neither kernel nor user-space have a reference to a slice, the slice
 * is released. The kernel reference can only be acquired/released once, but
 * user-space references can be published/released several times. In particular,
 * if the kernel retains a reference when a slice is published and later
 * released by userspace, the same slice can be published again in the future.
 *
 * Note that both kernel-space and user-space must be aware that slice
 * references are not ref-counted. They are simple booleans. For the kernel-side
 * this is obvious, as no ref/unref functions are provided. But user-space must
 * be aware that the same slice being published several times does not increase
 * the reference count.

 * A pool is used to allocate memory slices that can be shared between

 * entire pool, kernel-space gets read/write access via accessor-functions.
 *
 * Pools are used to transfer large sets of data to user-space, without
 * requiring a round-trip to ask user-space for a suitable memory chunk.
 * Instead, the kernel simply allocates slices in the pool and tells user-space
 * where it put the data.
 *
 * All pool operations must be serialized by the caller. No internal lock is
 * provided. Slices can be queried/modified unlocked. But any pool operation
 * (allocation, release, flush, ...) must be serialized.
