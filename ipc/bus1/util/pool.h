/**
 * DOC: Pools
 *
 * A pool is a shmem-backed memory pool shared between userspace and the kernel.
 * The pool is used to transfer memory from the kernel to userspace without
 * requiring userspace to allocate the memory.
 *
 * The pool is managed in slices, which are published to userspace when they are
 * ready to be read and must be released by userspace when userspace is done
 * with them.
 *
 * Userspace has read-only access to its pools and the kernel has read-write
 * access, but published slices are not altered.

/**
 * struct bus1_pool_slice - pool slice
 * @offset:		relative offset in parent pool
 * @size:		slice size
 * @free:		free space after slice
 * @published:		whether the slices has been published to user-space
 * @entry:		link into linear list of slices
 * @rb_offset:		link to slice rb-tree, indexed by offset
 * @rb_free:		link to slice rb-tree, indexed by free size
 * @next:		single-linked utility list
 *
 * Each chunk of memory in the pool is managed as a slice. A slice can be
 * accessible by both the kernel and user-space.
 *
 * To allow user-space access, the slice must be published. Note that all slices
 * are always readable by user-space, since the entire pool can be mapped.
 * Publishing a slice only marks the slice as such, so it will not be modified
 * or removed. Once user-space releases its reference, it should no longer
 * access the slice as it might be modified and/or overwritten by other data.
 *
 * A slice can be published and unpublished to user-space several times, but it
 * must only be released by the kernel if it is no longer published.
 *
 * Note that both kernel-space and user-space must be aware that slices are not
 * ref-counted. For the kernel-side this is obvious, as no ref/unref functions
 * are provided. But user-space must be aware that the same slice being
 * published several times does not increase the reference count.
 *
 * Each slice keeps track of the amount of free space after it in the pool, so
 * the free space can be reused in case of fragmentation.

 * A pool is used to allocate memory slices that can be shared between
 * kernel-space and user-space. A pool is always backed by a shmem-file and puts
 * a simple slice-allocator on top. User-space gets read-only access to the
 * entire pool, kernel-space gets read/write access via accessor-functions.
 *
 * Pools are used to transfer large sets of data to user-space, without
 * requiring a round-trip to ask user-space for a suitable memory chunk.
 * Instead, the kernel simply allocates slices in the pool and tells user-space
 * where it put the data.
 *
 * All pool operations must be serialized by the caller. No internal lock is
 * provided. Slices can be queried/modified unlocked. But any pool operation
 * (allocation, release, flush, ...) must be serialized.
