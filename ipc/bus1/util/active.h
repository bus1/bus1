/**
 * DOC: Active References
 *
 * The bus1_active object implements active references. They work similarly to
 * plain object reference counters, but allow disabling any new references from
 * being taken.
 *
 * Each bus1_active object goes through a set of states:
 *   NEW:       Initial state, no active references can be acquired
 *   ACTIVE:    Live state, active references can be acquired
 *   DRAINING:  Deactivated but lingering, no active references can be acquired
 *   DRAINED:   Deactivated and all active references were dropped
 *   RELEASED:  Fully drained and synchronously released
 *
 * Initially, all bus1_active objects are in state NEW. As soon as they're
 * activated, they enter ACTIVE and active references can be acquired. This is
 * the normal, live state. Once the object is deactivated, it enters state
 * DRAINING. No new active references can be acquired, but some threads might
 * still own active references. Once all those are dropped, the object enters
 * state DRAINED. Now the object can be released a *single* time, before it
 * enters state RELEASED and is finished. It cannot be re-used anymore.
 *
 * Active-references are very useful to track threads that call methods on an
 * object. As long as a method is running, an active reference is held, and as
 * such the object is usually protected from being destroyed. The destructor of
 * the object needs to deactivate *and* drain the object, before releasing
 * resources.
 *
 * Note that active-references cannot be used to manage their own backing
 * memory. That is, they do not replace normal reference counts.
