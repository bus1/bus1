/**
 * DOC: Bus1 Overview
 *
 * bus1 is a local IPC system, which provides a decentralized infrastructure to
 * share objects between local peers. The main building blocks are nodes and
 * handles. Nodes represent objects of a local peer, while handles represent
 * descriptors that point to a node. Nodes can be created and destroyed by any
 * peer, and they will always remain owned by their respective creator. Handles,
 * on the other hand, are used to refer to nodes and can be passed around with
 * messages as auxiliary data. Whenever a handle is transferred, the receiver
 * will get its own handle allocated, pointing to the same node as the original
 * handle.
 *
 * Any peer can send messages directed at one of their handles. This will
 * transfer the message to the owner of the node the handle points to. If a
 * peer does not posess a handle to a given node, it will not be able to send a
 * message to that node. That is, handles provide exclusive access management.
 * Anyone that somehow acquired a handle to a node is privileged to further
 * send this handle to other peers. As such, access management is transitive.
 * Once a peer acquired a handle, it cannot be revoked again. However, a node
 * owner can, at anytime, destroy a node. This will effectively unbind all
 * existing handles to that node on any peer, notifying each one of the
 * destruction.
 *
 * Unlike nodes and handles, peers cannot be addressed directly. In fact, peers
 * are completely disconnected entities. A peer is merely an anchor of a set of
 * nodes and handles, including an incoming message queue for any of those.
 * Whether multiple nodes are all part of the same peer, or part of different
 * peers does not affect the remote view of those. Peers solely exist as
 * management entity and command dispatcher to local processes.
 *
 * The set of actors on a system is completely decentralized. There is no
 * global component involved that provides a central registry or discovery
 * mechanism. Furthermore, communication between peers only involves those
 * peers, and does not affect any other peer in any way. No global
 * communication lock is taken. However, any communication is still globally
 * ordered, including unicasts, multicasts, and notifications.

/**
 * Locking
 *
 * Most of the bus1 objects form a hierarchy, as such, their locks must be
 * ordered. Not all orders are explicitly defined (e.g., they might define
 * orthogonal hierarchies), but this list gives a rough overview:
 *
 *   bus1_peer.active
 *     bus1_peer.local.lock
 *       bus1_peer.data.lock
 *         bus1_user.lock
 *         bus1_user_lock
